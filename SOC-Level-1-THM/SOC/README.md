# 🛡️ SOC Level 1 Capstone Challenges

## 📖 What are SOC Level 1 Capstone Challenges?
The **SOC Level 1 Capstone Challenges** are advanced exercises simulating real-world security operations center (SOC) scenarios.  
These challenges consolidate skills learned in threat detection, incident response, network analysis, and endpoint monitoring.

## 🎯 Skills Gained
- Conducting **multi-step SOC investigations**  
- Identifying **indicators of compromise (IOCs)** from malicious file uploads and network traffic  
- Performing **endpoint analysis** to detect hidden malware hooks and persistence mechanisms  
- Responding to ransomware-style incidents and **coordinating incident response**  
- Correlating logs and alerts to **identify attack patterns**  
- Developing reporting and **documentation skills** for SOC incidents

## ✅ Lessons Learned
- End-to-end SOC investigations require **correlating multiple sources of evidence** (network, endpoint, SIEM).  
- Understanding attack chains and tactics helps in **quick detection and response**.  
- Handling ransomware incidents emphasizes **timely containment, remediation, and reporting**.  
- Capstone challenges simulate the pressures and decision-making of a real SOC environment.
