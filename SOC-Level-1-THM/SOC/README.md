# 🛡️ SOC Level 1 Capstone Challenges

## 📖 What are SOC Level 1 Capstone Challenges?
The **SOC Level 1 Capstone Challenges** are advanced, hands-on scenarios that replicate real-world **Security Operations Center (SOC)** environments.  
Each challenge focuses on key aspects of **threat detection**, **incident response**, **malware analysis**, and **log correlation** — putting all the skills I gained throughout my SOC Level 1 learning path into practice.

## 📑 Case Studies

### 1. **Boogeyman Series (1–3): Incident Correlation & Threat Detection**
In this three-part challenge, I investigated a series of escalating threats inside a simulated enterprise environment.  
I started by analyzing suspicious logs in the SIEM, uncovering a phishing campaign that led to privilege escalation and lateral movement.  
Through careful event correlation, I identified persistence mechanisms and traced the attacker’s full kill chain — from **initial access** to **data exfiltration**.

### 2. **Tempest Challenge: Full-Scope Threat Investigation**
This capstone challenge required performing a complete SOC investigation from alert triage to remediation.  
I analyzed endpoint activity, reviewed malicious PowerShell execution, and correlated SIEM events to identify command-and-control communication.  
By following structured IR steps, I isolated the compromised endpoint, extracted IOCs, and recommended mitigation controls.  
This exercise reinforced my understanding of **real-world SOC workflows** and **incident prioritization**.

## ✅ Lessons Learned
- SOC investigations rely on **precision, patience, and pattern recognition**.  
- Effective threat response requires understanding both **tactics (TTPs)** and **context** behind alerts.  
- Documentation and clear communication are just as vital as technical skills.  
- Capstone exercises revealed how **different attack stages connect** across network and endpoint layers.
