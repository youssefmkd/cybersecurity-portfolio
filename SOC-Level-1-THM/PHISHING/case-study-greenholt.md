# üìù Case Study: The Greenholt Phish

## üîπ Overview
In this case study, I investigated a suspicious email received by a sales executive.  
The executive was not expecting this email, which mentioned a money transfer and contained an unexpected attachment. This scenario simulated a phishing attempt.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Email header analysis
- Extraction of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- File hash and metadata analysis
- DNS, SPF, and DMARC verification
- Attachment inspection and threat validation

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
- Email originated from a suspicious IP and domain.  
- Header analysis revealed mismatched Return-Path and Reply-To addresses.  
- Attachment was potentially malicious, confirmed by SHA256 hash and file inspection.  
- SPF and DMARC checks helped validate email authentication and origin.

**Lessons Learned:**  
- Always inspect email headers carefully to detect anomalies.  
- Use MXToolbox, Thunderbird, VirusTotal, and other tools to validate suspicious emails and attachments.  
- Extracting IOCs from phishing emails is essential to prevent credential theft or malware infection.  
- Bookmark trusted phishing analysis tools to streamline future investigations.
