## ✅ Lessons Learned
- DFIR investigations require **correlating evidence across multiple sources** (logs, memory, disk).  
- Tools like **Autopsy** and **Redline** accelerate analysis but still require analyst interpretation.  
- Memory forensics with **Volatility** is key to uncovering hidden malware activity.  
- Collaboration tools like **TheHive** streamline incident tracking and reporting.  
- Simulated case studies (Unattended, Disgruntled, Critical, Secret Recipe) helped build **real-world DFIR workflows**.
