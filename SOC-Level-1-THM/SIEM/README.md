# ðŸ“Š SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)

## ðŸ“– What is SIEM?
**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** is a technology that provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications, network devices, and systems.  
It helps security analysts **detect, investigate, and respond to threats** efficiently by collecting logs, correlating events, and visualizing security data.
