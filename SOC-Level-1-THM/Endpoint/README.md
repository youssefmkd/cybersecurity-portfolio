# 🛡️ Endpoint Security Monitoring

## 📖 What is Endpoint Security Monitoring?
**Endpoint Security Monitoring** involves continuously observing endpoints such as workstations, servers, and devices for malicious activity, unauthorized access, or policy violations.  
It combines log analysis, behavioral monitoring, and security tools to detect and respond to threats at the endpoint level.

## ✅ Lessons Learned
- Continuous monitoring of endpoints is crucial for early detection of threats.  
- Sysinternals provides deep visibility into processes, registry activity, and network connections.  
- Sysmon logs allow for the creation of targeted detection rules to identify suspicious behavior.  
- Osquery enables querying endpoint artifacts efficiently across multiple systems.  
- Wazuh integrates logs, alerts, and detection rules to improve overall endpoint security posture.  
- Combining multiple tools increases detection accuracy and supports incident response workflows.
