# 🛡️ Cyber Defense Frameworks (CDF)

## 📖 What is Cyber Defense Frameworks?
**Cyber Defense Frameworks (CDF)** are structured models and methodologies used to understand, detect, and respond to cyber threats.  
They help security teams analyze attacker behavior, assess defenses, and implement effective strategies for incident detection and response.
