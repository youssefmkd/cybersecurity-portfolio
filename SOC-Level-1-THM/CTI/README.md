# 🛡️ Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

## 📖 What is Cyber Threat Intelligence?
**Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** involves the collection, analysis, and sharing of information about threats to an organization’s digital assets.  
CTI helps security teams proactively detect, prevent, and respond to attacks by understanding threat actors, their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
