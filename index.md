# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Portfolio** — a collection of my practical work in **SOC operations, cloud security, incident response, digital forensics, and threat analysis**.  
Here, I document hands-on labs, investigations, and real-world simulations that reflect my journey toward becoming a **well-rounded cybersecurity and cloud engineer**.

Each project demonstrates my technical skills, problem-solving process, and ability to analyze, detect, and respond to security incidents using modern tools and frameworks.
