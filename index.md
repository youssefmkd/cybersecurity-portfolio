# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome! This is my **hands-on cybersecurity portfolio**, documenting labs, investigations, and projects across **SOC analysis, incident response, endpoint monitoring, network defense, cloud security, and real-world scenarios**. It highlights practical experience from SOC Level 1 labs, Google Cloud Security Command Center projects, and IBM cybersecurity case studies and capstone exercises.
